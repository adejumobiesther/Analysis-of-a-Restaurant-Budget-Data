# Analysis of a Restaurant Budget Data
This repository contains data from a restaurant that produces and sells salads, sandwiches and smoothies. 
The restaurant has generated a budget of the quantity of products they wish to sell for the next financial year. 
In this repository, I have used Python and SQL to:
* Automate loading of the budget data in excel format into the postgreSQL database
* Generate a report of the quantities and total costs for raw materials required to produce the targeted sales of products.
* Generate a report of the aggregate cost of the products.
* Compute the selling price of each product and the total amount to be realised per month per product based on the budget if the company wishes to sell the products with a 30% profit on the raw materials.
